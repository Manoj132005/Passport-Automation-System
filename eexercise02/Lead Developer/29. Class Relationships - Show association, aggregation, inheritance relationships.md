## Class Relationships  
### Association, Aggregation, and Inheritance

---

## 1️.Association Relationships

**Association** represents a general connection between two classes where one class uses or interacts with another.

### Associations in Passport Automation System:

- **User ↔ PassportApplication**
  - A user can submit **one or more passport applications**
  - Each application belongs to **one user**

- **PassportApplication ↔ Payment**
  - Each application is associated with **one payment**
  - Payment is made specifically for a passport application

- **PassportApplication ↔ Document**
  - One application can have **multiple documents**
  - Documents are uploaded for verification

- **PassportApplication ↔ PoliceVerification**
  - Each application may require **police verification**
  - Verification status affects application approval

- **PassportOfficer ↔ PassportApplication**
  - Officers review and process applications

## 2️.Aggregation Relationships

**Aggregation** is a “has-a” relationship where child objects can exist independently of the parent.

### Aggregations in Passport Automation System:

- **PassportApplication ⬅ Document**
  - An application *has multiple documents*
  - Documents can exist even if the application is temporarily inactive

- **PassportApplication ⬅ PoliceVerification**
  - Police verification is linked to an application
  - Verification records can exist independently for audit purposes

- **Admin ⬅ PassportOfficer**
  - Admin manages multiple officers
  - Officers can exist even if admin changes

---

## 3️.Inheritance Relationships

**Inheritance** represents an “is-a” relationship where one class inherits properties and methods of another.

### Inheritance in Passport Automation System:

- **User (Parent Class)**
  - **Admin (Child Class)**
  - **PassportOfficer (Child Class)**

Both `Admin` and `PassportOfficer` inherit common attributes like:
- userId  
- username  
- login()  

This avoids redundancy and improves code reusability.
