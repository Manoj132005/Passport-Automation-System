# Problem 36: Deployment Diagram

## Overview
A deployment diagram was created for the Passport Automation System to represent the physical deployment of software components on hardware nodes.

## Nodes
- **User Device** – Used by applicants and officials to access the system  
- **Web Server** – Hosts the passport automation application  
- **Database Server** – Stores application, user, and verification data  

## Deployment Description

| Node | Responsibility |
|-----|---------------|
| User Device | Access the system through a web browser |
| Web Server | Process requests and manage application logic |
| Database Server | Store and retrieve passport-related data |

## Purpose
The deployment diagram helps in understanding how system components are physically distributed and how they communicate at runtime.
