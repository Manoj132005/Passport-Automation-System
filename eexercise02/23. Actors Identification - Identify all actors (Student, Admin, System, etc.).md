# Problem 23: Actors Identification

## Overview
For the Passport Automation System, actors were identified to represent all external users and systems that interact with the application.

## Identified Actors
- **Applicant** – Citizen applying for a passport  
- **Passport Officer** – Government official responsible for verification  
- **System Administrator** – Manages system operations and user access  

## Purpose
Actor identification helps define system boundaries and clarifies user responsibilities.
