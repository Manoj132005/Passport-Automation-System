# Problem 22: Project Structure Creation

## Overview
For the SEAD project titled **“Passport Automation System”**, a well-organized project structure was created using the CASE tool to manage system models, documentation, and design artifacts efficiently.

## Project Structure
The project was divided into logical sections to clearly separate different design aspects:

- Requirements Documentation  
- Use Case Models  
- Class Models  
- Sequence Diagrams  
- Activity Diagrams  
- Component Diagrams  
- Deployment Diagrams  

## Purpose
The structured organization was created to:
- Improve clarity and readability of system models  
- Support easy navigation within the CASE tool  
- Enable parallel development and documentation  
- Simplify maintenance and future updates
