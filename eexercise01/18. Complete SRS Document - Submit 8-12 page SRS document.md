- Email/SMS services for notifications  

### 2.2 Product Functions
The major functions of the system include:

- User registration and login  
- Online passport application submission  
- Uploading and managing documents  
- Appointment scheduling for verification  
- Application status tracking  
- Admin and officer verification panel  
- Approval or rejection of applications  
- Notification system (email/SMS)  
- User and role management
