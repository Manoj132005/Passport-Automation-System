# Passport Automation System  

---

## 1. Introduction

Risk Management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and controlling potential risks that may affect the successful development and deployment of the Passport Automation System. This document outlines the risks involved and the strategies adopted to mitigate them.

---

## 2. Objectives of Risk Management

- Identify potential risks in the project
- Analyze the impact and probability of risks
- Plan mitigation and contingency measures
- Ensure smooth and secure system operation
- Reduce project failure and delays

---

## 3. Risk Identification Tools

- RiskWatch tool
- Team brainstorming sessions
- Past project analysis
- Periodic project reviews

---

## 4. Risk Categories

- Technical Risks
- Security Risks
- Operational Risks
- Schedule Risks
- Legal and Compliance Risks

---

## 5. Risk Assessment Criteria

- **Probability:** Low / Medium / High  
- **Impact:** Low / Medium / High  
- **Risk Level:** Based on Probability × Impact

---

## 6. Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------|-----------------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| R1 | Data security breach | High | High | Use encryption, authentication, and regular security audits |
| R2 | Server downtime | Medium | High | Implement backup servers and load balancing |
| R3 | Delay in application processing | Medium | Medium | Automate verification and parallel processing |
| R4 | Database failure | Low | High | Regular database backups and recovery plans |
| R5 | User data entry errors | Medium | Medium | Input validation and user-friendly UI |
| R6 | Legal or policy changes | Low | High | Regular updates based on government regulations |
| R7 | Unauthorized access | Medium | High | Role-based access control and secure login |

---

## 7. Risk Monitoring and Control

- Risks are continuously monitored throughout the project lifecycle
- Risk status is updated as Open, Mitigated, or Closed
- Periodic risk review meetings are conducted
- RiskWatch generates reports for tracking risk status

---

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Manager:** Approves risk mitigation plans
- **Risk Manager:** Maintains risk register and monitoring
- **Development Team:** Implements mitigation strategies
- **Testing Team:** Verifies risk control measures

---

## 9. RiskWatch Tool Usage

RiskWatch is used to:
- Identify and document risks
- Assess probability and impact
- Generate automated risk reports
- Track risk mitigation progress

---

## 10. Conclusion

Effective risk management ensures the Passport Automation System is developed securely, efficiently, and within schedule. The use of RiskWatch and structured mitigation strategies minimizes project uncertainties and improves system reliability.
